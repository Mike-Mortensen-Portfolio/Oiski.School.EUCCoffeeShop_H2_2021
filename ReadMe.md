# Oiski's EUC Coffee Shop

## Quick Note
As the assignment wasn't fully specified and the teacher couldn't provide us (_students_) with enough information on the assignment the program was cut short and we (_students_) where therefore unable to finish the project as originally intended due to time restriction.
This means that the program lacks features that I originally intended to be implemented but had to take out to accomodate the new deadline and program specifications provided by our teacher.


## About The Project
The project is a beginner level assignment where we have to build a _storage-system_ for a Coffee Shop named **EUC Coffee Shop**.
The point of the assignment is to demonstrate our competence regarding the use and design of WPF applications.

### Terms of Development
The application must include, but is not limited to, the following elements:
- **Classes**
  - Coffee
  - SuperiorCoffee
- **Enums**
  - Country
- **Interfaces**
  - ICoffeeRepository

As such the following Diagram was written by me, as the structural design for the project (_It is based on the assignments UML diagram_):\
![CoffeeShopStorageDiagram](https://github.com/Mike-Mortensen-Portfolio/Oiski.School.EUCCoffeeShop_H2_2021/blob/Developer/EUCCoffeeShopExtendedStorageDiagram.png)

The interface must be written in XAML and be build as a _Windows Presentation Foundation_ application with code behind written in C#.
I've therefore designed the program to implement two projects.
 1. **A Graphical User Interface (_GUI_)** - WPF Application
 2. **A C# Class Library** - Defines the functionality for the application

## Versioning
The Assignment specifies that versioning should be done according to the following template: [_Major_].[_Minor_].[_Path_].\
Each `Feature` must be branched out and developed on an isolated branch and merged back into the `Developer` branch when done.

The syntax for the structure of folders must be presented as: [DeveloperName]/[Version]/[BranchName], where as branches should be named as follows: [*Version*]-[*Feature*]_[*SubFeature*].\
**Example:**
>**Folder Structure:** _Oiski/v1_ \
>**Branch Name:** _1.0.0-Interface_MainMenu_ \
>**Full Path:** _Oiski/v1/1.0.0-Interface_MainMenu__
